# tmux

## Install

Make sure that you also install the TPM (tmux package manager) the first time:

```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Then open up `tmux` and install all plugins by `<C-a><Shift>i`. This installs
all plugins and tmux should be up and running.
