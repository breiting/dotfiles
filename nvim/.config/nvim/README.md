# neovim configuration

This folder stores my current neovim (>= 0.10.x) configuration. It is based
on the kickstarter project and uses the split module approach.

I use `mason` as the LSP server package installer. The packages should be
installed automatically, once neovim is called the first time.

Please do not copy and use the configuration directly but rather get inspired
and write your own configuration.
